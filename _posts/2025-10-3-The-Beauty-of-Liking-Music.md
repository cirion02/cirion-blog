This post is me just writing out some thoughts I have, enjoy :)

I've discovered my inner love for music by discarding the notions of good or pleasing others. I have found being negative about music does no good to anyone, including myself. If I don't like a song, who cares, if someone else doesn't like a song, who cares. Furthermore, quality is overrated. 

Now that's a bit hyperbolic, quality can enhance your enjoyment of a work, but I advocate for not letting the absence of quality detract from it. Enjoying things much as possible has only had positive outcomes for me. Now, I believe that much of personal enjoyment is not up to your conscious being, but not letting what you can control detract from your enjoyment is worthwhile to me. I didn't let myself enjoy so called "cringe" music because my conscious mind didn't want to seem wrong. Be that minecraft parodies I enjoyed as a kid and still feel nostalgia for, or pop music people call boring and formulaic. I have similar thoughts about so called "bad" music, I enjoy plenty of music that is not put together very well, or is critically panned. But I enjoy it, and that's what really matters. 

Really I try to apply this attitude to most of my life, being happy and enjoying things is good, and I strive to enjoy the things I like, be that music, mtg or anything else.

That being said, I will now indulge and talk about some songs and albums I've been enjoying lately:

[my twee monsters by tracey brakes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kt22RZ6WiG7b6P6k63WKzrYq3m--dJ_vk)
I've been listening this album a lot, I greatly enjoy the contrast in the calm and very not calm parts. I like the way the tracks flow into each other a lot, and overall just really like the whole album.

[Rainbow Girl by Cavetown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgYjOc4FMjk)
Just a nice calm love song, sounds very pretty, lyrics are nice. Just a song I enjoy listening too.

[it's a seal! by justin oval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VDg9Gj0Uj4)
Extremely silly, cute and fun song. I like slightly comedic music, and justin oval is just good at making music that hits just right for me.
